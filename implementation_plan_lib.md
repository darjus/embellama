# Implementation Plan: Embellama Core Library

This document outlines the phased implementation plan for the `embellama` core library component. Each phase is designed to be independently implementable with clear deliverables and success criteria.

## Critical Design Constraint

**⚠️ IMPORTANT**: The `LlamaContext` from `llama-cpp-2` is `!Send` and `!Sync`. This means:
- Context cannot be moved between threads
- Context cannot be shared using `Arc`
- Each thread must own its model instance
- All concurrency must use message passing

## Implementation Notes

### Self-Referential Struct Solution

The `LlamaContext` holds a reference to `LlamaModel`, creating a self-referential struct challenge. This was solved using the `self_cell` crate:

1. **The Problem**: `LlamaContext<'a>` borrows from `LlamaModel` with lifetime `'a`
2. **The Solution**: Use `self_cell::self_cell!` macro to safely create a self-referential struct
3. **Implementation**:
   ```rust
   self_cell! {
       struct ModelCell {
           owner: LlamaModel,
           #[covariant]
           dependent: LlamaContext,
       }
   }
   ```
4. **Access Pattern**: 
   - Use `cell.borrow_owner()` to access the model
   - Use `cell.borrow_dependent()` to access the context
   - The macro ensures proper lifetime management and drop order

### Thread Safety Considerations

Due to the `!Send` constraint of `LlamaContext`:

1. **Never attempt to share models between threads**
   ```rust
   // ❌ Won't compile
   let model = Arc::new(EmbeddingModel::new(...)?);
   
   // ✅ Correct approach
   thread_local! {
       static MODEL: RefCell<Option<EmbeddingModel>> = RefCell::new(None);
   }
   ```

2. **Use message passing for concurrent operations**
   ```rust
   // For the library, batch processing uses:
   // - Parallel pre-processing (rayon)
   // - Sequential model inference (single thread)
   // - Parallel post-processing (rayon)
   ```

3. **Each worker thread needs its own model instance**
   - This increases memory usage but ensures thread safety
   - Models cannot be pooled or shared
   - Consider model lazy loading to manage memory

### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test with real GGUF models
3. **Property Tests**: Use `proptest` for edge cases
4. **Benchmarks**: Track performance regressions
5. **Thread Safety Tests**: Verify compile-time guarantees

### Performance Targets

- Single embedding: <50ms (CPU), <10ms (GPU)
- Batch throughput: >1000 embeddings/second
- Memory overhead: <2x model size
- Startup time: <5 seconds for 1GB model

### Error Handling Philosophy

- Use `Result<T, E>` everywhere
- Provide context in errors
- Make errors actionable
- Never panic in library code
- Log errors appropriately
